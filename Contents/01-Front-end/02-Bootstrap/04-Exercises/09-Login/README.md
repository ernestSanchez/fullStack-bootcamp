## Background & Objectives

We're going to review again what you learned from bootstrap forms. This time we're going to make another different kind of form...

## Specs

Open with the browser the file `login.html` (but not with atom! don't look at the code!)

Your mission now is to make a login form like the one you have just seen using bootstrap components.

You have already some styles on the `css` folder. You already have also a link to them on your `index.html` file.
