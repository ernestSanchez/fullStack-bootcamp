## Background & Objectives

Forms are a very important part of every website. They are the only point from which user can send their data.

From log-in forms to contact forms, almost every website has one of these. As logical, <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/">Bootstrap has its own components for forms elements.</a>

## Specs

You have to create a contact form like the one you will find on the `result.html` file.

Create one `index.html` file, add bootstrap (and jQuery) to the head, create one very simple grid and start adding inputs and buttons to it.

You can open the `result.html` file with your browser to see the result, but don't look at the code (no spoilers!)
