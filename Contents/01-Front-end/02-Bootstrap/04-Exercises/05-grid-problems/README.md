## Background & Objectives

We are going to review what you have learn about bootstrap's grid system. This time in a different approach...

## Specs

You have just started to work for a new company as a web developer. Your manager comes to the first meeting and she gives you your first project:

An old employee created the page of the company with boostrap, but he didn't know how to use the grid system of bootstrap. As result, he did the page without any grid at all. You can see the disaster by opening the `index.html` file with your browser.

That's a ugly page! Your mission: add a grid system to the existing page and make it look better.

You can open the file `result.html` with your browser, but don't look at the code unless you get stucked. Try to solve this by yourself.

Also, remember to test your website on small screens to make sure it is responsive.
