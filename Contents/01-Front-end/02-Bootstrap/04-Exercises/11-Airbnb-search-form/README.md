## Background & Objectives

This challenge is very simillar to the previous one. If you did it successfully, you can probably re-use many lines of code. And that's the key of this exercise: you will have to re-use your previous code.

## Specs

Copy the `index.html` file of the previous exercise and paste it on this folder. This time you have to add a search form inside the page. Open the `result.html` file with the browser to get the main idea.

This exercise will show you how much important is to make clear and re-usable code.

Again, you have some already done styles on the `css` folder, and the important images inside the `images` folder.
