## Background & Objectives

This time the challenge is getting serious! Are you able to reproduce one of the most visited home pages of the world?

## Specs

On the `result.html` file you have an example of airbnb's home page made with bootstrap. Your mission is to put into practice EVERYTHING you have learnt until now and make a new `index.html` file as simillar as possible to the `result.html` file.

Remember to start by just creating an empty grid structure with rows and columns. After that, you can start adding components inside the structure.

You have some styles already done on the `css` folder. You can just add a link to the styles inside your HTML.
