## Background & Objectives

As you already know, popovers are little messages that are shown when the user hovers on an element. These are very useful when you need to show very detailed information in a minimalistic way, as you can show the details progressively as the user interacts with the elements.

Popovers are components built-in from bootstrap. You can see <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/popovers/">the documentation here.</a>

## Specs

You are working on a social forum where users can post and read entries. At this moment you are doing a page to display the history of posts from the users.

Open with your browser the file `demo.html` and put the mouse over some image. Your mission is to replicate the same work inside the file `index.html`.

You have some styles ready on the file `popover.css`, so you only have to focus on the HTML tags and the classes.

## Tips

- Give yourself some minutes to read carefully the base HTML code you have on the `index.html` file.

- Open it with the browser too, experiment with the elements' inspector of the browser.

- Read the documentation of bootstrap about popovers components.

- Take a look at the JavaScript code you have at the end of the file, insde the `<script>` tags. This code is tremendously important for the popovers to work. This time it is already done for you, but on the future you will need to do it by yourself. So maybe you want to save or remember this for future situations.
